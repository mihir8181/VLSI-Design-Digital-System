# VLSI-Design-Digital-System
This is a VLSI designing Project. This Project is created using Cadence Virtuoso software. 


It Includes Basic Logic Gates to simple ALU design.

Logic Gates like AND,OR,NAND,NOR XOR. Also used this Logic Gates to design Inverter, Transmission Gate, 1-Bit Add/Subtract, 4-Bit Adder, Multipler, Divider, D-FlipFlop, 2:1, 8:1 Multiplexer.

Check PDF for more details. There is screenshots of all circuit's Schematic, Symbol, testbench, Simulation, Layout, Postlayout-simulation, DRC, LVS and calulations.
